# Video-Summarizer-in-Marathi


Video summarization system is powered by
a transformation-based algorithm, the Gemini API for
summarization, and Streamlit for an interactive frontend
interface. With an ever-increasing number of Marathi video
contents, the system fills the gap of efficiently extracting
relevant information from long videos without
compromising on language and contextual integrity. Audio
is extracted from video files, and speech-to-text conversion
uses advanced Marathi-optimized speech-to-text
technology. Whatever is transcribed forms part of text data
that is fed through a transformation-based algorithm that
preprocesses it, putting it into a desired format for Gemini
API, which gives summary information in abbreviated,
contextually appropriate paragraphs. The frontend,
implemented with Streamlit, allows for video uploading,
summary viewing, and interaction all in one seamless
experience. These transformations on textual data yield
enhanced quality and coherence of generated summaries.
